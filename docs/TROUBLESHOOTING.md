## Quick Diagnostics

1) Run environment tests:
   - `npm run test:env`
   - Expected: No missing core environment variables, basic Node and dependency checks pass.

2) Verify proxy connectivity with exit IP:
   - `npm run test:proxy`
   - Expected: Reported IP is non-empty and consistent across system logs and results.

3) Component integration smoke test:
   - `node tests/test-integration.js`
   - For full run: `RUN_FULL_INTEGRATION=true node tests/test-integration.js` (will create real accounts)

4) Health check:
   - `node scripts/health-check.js`

## Logs and Artifacts

- Application logs: `./logs/` (daily rotate with gzip)
  - Combined/app logs: `logs/combined-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, `logs/app-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
  - Errors: `logs/error-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
  - Registrations (JSON): `logs/registrations-*` style application event logs and per-registration JSON in `logs/registrations/` if configured
  - Batches (JSON): `logs/batches/` summaries if configured
- Temp artifacts:
  - Profiles: `./temp/profiles/`
  - Screenshots on error (optional): `./temp/screenshots/`
  - HTML on error (optional): `./temp/screenshots/*.html`

Enable more diagnostics via environment:
- `DEBUG_MODE=true`
- `SCREENSHOT_ON_ERROR=true`
- `SAVE_HTML_ON_ERROR=true`
- `BROWSER_HEADLESS=false` (interactive debugging)

## Common Issues

### 1) Proxy Connectivity and Exit IP

Symptoms:
- Requests time out when launching or navigating
- Proxy test fails in `tests/test-proxy.js`
- Result JSON shows `proxy.ip: null` or missing

Checks:
- Verify `.env`:
  - `PROXY_HOST`, `PROXY_PORT`, `PROXY_USERNAME`, `PROXY_PASSWORD`, `PROXY_TYPE`
- Run `npm run test:proxy` and confirm:
  - Success with valid `ip`
- In code paths, `ProxyManager.getWorkingProxy()` now sets `ip` after successful verification
- Confirm `src/main.js` result object includes `proxy: { sessionId, ip }`

Fixes:
- Correct credentials and provider network access
- Reduce rate by lowering concurrency and increasing delays
- If auth proxies need proxy-chain, rely on built-in handling in `src/stealth-browser.js`

### 2) Dolphin Anty Integration

Symptoms:
- Failure to create or start Anty profiles
- No WebSocket endpoint from Anty
- Hard requirement error for `DOLPHIN_ANTY_HOST`

Checks:
- Anty is optional. System falls back to regular stealth browser when Anty is not configured or fails
- Ensure Anty app is running and API is reachable if used
- Env:
  - Optional unless `--use-dolphin` or `DOLPHIN_ANTY_TOKEN` is set
  - When required: `DOLPHIN_ANTY_HOST`, `DOLPHIN_ANTY_TOKEN`

Fixes:
- Remove `--use-dolphin` if not needed
- Start Anty and verify: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DOLPHIN_ANTY_TOKEN" $DOLPHIN_ANTY_HOST/v1.0/browser_profiles`
- Let automation fallback to regular launch

### 3) Browser Launch and Stability

Symptoms:
- Browser fails to start or connect
- Immediate crashes or closed sessions

Checks:
- Set `BROWSER_HEADLESS=false` to observe
- Check logs for launch options and proxy args
- Verify that `puppeteer` is compatible with OS and Node version

Fixes:
- Reduce `CONCURRENT_INSTANCES`
- Increase timeouts: `BROWSER_TIMEOUT`
- Clear temp profiles: `rm -rf temp/profiles/*` (or use cleanup script)

### 4) Google Signup Flow

Symptoms:
- Form interactions blocked
- Unexpected layout/captcha/phone-verification issues

Checks:
- Proxy exit IP quality and geolocation consistency
- Human-like timing is applied (stealth helpers and delays)
- Captcha service availability

Fixes:
- Increase randomized delays in `.env`
- Switch to better proxies
- Run visible browser for manual inspection of selectors and steps

### 5) Kilocode OAuth and Registration

Symptoms:
- OAuth redirects fail or hang
- Registration data incomplete in results

Checks:
- Verify that Google account is created (when not skipped)
- Review `kilocode-registration` logs and navigation waits
- Ensure bonus collection waits long enough

Fixes:
- Increase `KILOCODE_REGISTRATION_DELAY` and timeouts
- Add debug screenshots/HTML
- Validate selectors for current UI version

### 6) Captcha Solving

Symptoms:
- Captchas remain unsolved or time out
- Low success rate

Checks:
- `TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY` and account balance
- Captcha timeout: `CAPTCHA_TIMEOUT`
- Logs showing captcha type and solve times

Fixes:
- Increase timeout
- Fund captcha account or rotate to another service
- Reduce concurrency to avoid triggering captchas

### 7) File System and Permissions

Symptoms:
- Cannot write logs, registrations, or screenshots
- Cleanup errors

Checks:
- Verify the app has write permissions to `./logs` and `./temp`
- Windows path issues

Fixes:
- Run terminal with appropriate privileges
- Ensure directories are created (setup wizard does this)
- Use cleanup script to remove stale artifacts

---

## Recovery and Cleanup

- Rotate/compress large logs and prune old artifacts:
  - `node scripts/cleanup.js --force`
  - Large logs are gzip-compressed, old logs deleted based on retention
- Remove stale profiles:
  - `node scripts/cleanup.js --force --no-logs` (to focus on profiles)
- Reset counters:
  - `node scripts/cleanup.js --reset`

---

## Advanced Diagnostics

- Enable debug and visible browser:
  - `DEBUG_MODE=true BROWSER_HEADLESS=false npm start`
- Capture artifacts on errors:
  - `SCREENSHOT_ON_ERROR=true SAVE_HTML_ON_ERROR=true`
- Inspect per-registration data:
  - Registration JSON will include `proxy.ip` for traceability

## FAQ

Q: Is Dolphin Anty required?
- No. The system launches a regular stealth browser when Anty is not configured or profile creation fails. Use `--use-dolphin` only if you want to enforce Anty usage along with a valid token.

Q: Why is exit IP missing in results?
- Ensure the proxy connectivity test succeeds. The working proxy now includes `ip` on success, and the result object uses that value.

Q: Can I run a dry run without creating any accounts?
- Yes. Use `--dry-run` or pass `dryRun: true` with `skipAccountCreation` and `skipKilocodeRegistration`. The flow will launch and close a browser and return a `dry_run_completed` status.

Q: Where do I find API usage?
- See API Reference at `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`.

Q: How do I deploy to production?
- See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for hardening, scaling, monitoring, and security guidance.

Q: Where is a test overview?
- See `TESTING.md` for strategy, commands, and acceptance criteria.
